## Disclaimer
- I have created and maintained this repository for **educational purposes**.
- **It may contain errors!** _(I compiled and ran all of the projects with the [Code::Blocks IDE](http://www.codeblocks.org), so it should not contain compilation errors...)_
- I welcome **bug reports** and **constructive criticism**!
